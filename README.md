## Features

The dataset includes various textual features extracted from news articles, providing a comprehensive view of linguistic patterns and content-related attributes.

## Preprocessing Techniques

The textual data undergoes preprocessing techniques, including:
- Tokenization
- Stemming

These techniques are applied to transform the raw text data into a format suitable for machine learning algorithms.

## TF-IDF Vectorization

The TfidfVectorizer is employed to convert raw text data into numerical features based on TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency). This process plays a crucial role in detecting fake news by creating feature representations that capture important information from the textual data.

## Machine Learning Algorithm

Logistic Regression, a powerful classification algorithm, is utilized to train the model. The model learns to differentiate between genuine and fake news based on patterns and feature representations derived from the preprocessed textual data.

## How to Use
